## Solitaire

Almost everyone in the 90's spent countless hours on the computer playing the Solitaire game included with Windows whenever they were offline (when being offline was a thing) and this is a way of reliving those memories -- but with some fresh new cards.

## About

It had been awhile since I've worked on a new Android application so I wanted to get back into it and check out the scene. Having never worked with Kotlin before, this was a fun experience. Working with the new-ish langauge seems to simplify the development process for Android, with less code and an easier time accessing and modifying views through activities. 

Anko is a code-first approach to developing views, removing the need for XML layouts entirely if you would like -- as with this project here.

The cards use in this project were made in Adobe Illustrator. I do not own Pokemon and am not sure about the legality of making cards that have Pokemon characters on them, but as I'm not monetizing this or releasing it on the Play Store, I don't foresee much of a problem with just playing around with them.
